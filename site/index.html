    <h1>Hello visitor!</h1>
    <p>If you've stumbled across this repository or page, you've found where I'm doing all of my assignments and learning that I'm doing via Coursera.</p>
    <p>I'll add to this as I go, for now ... feel free to explore but don't plan on being impressed at this point.</p>
    <p><a href="htmlcssjs-JohnHopkins/index.html">HTML, CSS, & JavaScript from John Hopkins</a></p>
