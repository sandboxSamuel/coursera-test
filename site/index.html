    <h1>Hello visitor!</h1>
    <p>If you've stumbled across this repository or page, you've found where I'm doing all of my assignments and learning that I'm doing via Coursera.</p>
    <p>I'll add to this as I go, for now ... feel free to explore but don't plan on being impressed at this point.</p>
    <p>The first course I took was <a href="htmlcssjs-JohnHopkins/index.html">HTML, CSS, & JavaScript from John Hopkins.</a> While I did learn some things I was dissapointed in the JavaScript portion.</p>
    <p>So I sought out something with a deeper look at javaScript and found <a href="interactivitywithjs-UniversityofMichigan/index.html">Interactivity with JS from the University of Michigan</a> & decided to give it a go.</p>
    <p>I'm currently taking this course, I'll keep you posted once I'm done.</p>
    <p>If you are so inclined, feel free to checkout my personal site below.</p>
